## Planned Features

- Real-time hardware monitoring (CPU, GPU, RAM, temperatures)
- CPU governor control (Performance/Balanced/Power Save)
- Gaming tools (ProtonDB/SteamDB integration)
- vkBasalt GUI configuration

## Development History

Started as a Godot Engine prototype (archived in separate [branch](https://github.com/DopaLin-project/DopaLin/tree/dopalin-godot-prototype)) to test the UI/UX concepts. Now rebuilding in C++/Qt for better performance and direct hardware access.
